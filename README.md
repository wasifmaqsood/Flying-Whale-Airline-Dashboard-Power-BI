**Introduction:**
I analyzed customer loyalty and flight activity data for FlyingWhale Airline and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key insights. The project focused on trends in enrollments, cancellations, and loyalty segmentation, helping the airline identify patterns and improve its loyalty programs. The final dashboard provided a clear, actionable overview of the airline's customer base for better decision-making.

**Scenario**
FlyingWhale Airline, a leading international airline, is facing challenges in maintaining customer loyalty and optimizing its loyalty programs. Despite a growing customer base, an increasing number of cancellations and shifting customer behavior are raising concerns. The airline wants to strengthen its business intelligence by analyzing Customer Flight Activity and Loyalty History to enhance the customer experience, improve retention, and better understand loyalty trends.

**Data Overview**
The data for this analysis was sourced from two CSV files on GitHub, covering the years 2017 and 2018. Key variables include Loyalty Number as a unique customer identifier, Demographics such as country, province, gender, education, salary, and marital status, as well as Enrollment and Cancellation Details that capture dates related to loyalty program participation. Additionally, the dataset includes Flight Activity, indicating customer flight frequency, Loyalty Card Tier, which categorizes membership levels into Aurora, Nova, and Star, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

**Data Cleaning**
The data cleaning process ensured accuracy by removing over 1,000 duplicate entries from the Flight Activity CSV, correcting data types for proper analysis, and creating new columns such as Enrollment Duration and Cancellation Month Number to enhance insights into customer behavior.
